# Applied Agentic AI Assignment

This repository contains the implementations of three Agentic AI laboratory experiments developed using Python and Ollama.

## Experiments

### EXP1 - Text-to-SQL Workflow

A natural language question is converted into an SQL query and executed on a SQLite database.

Technologies:
- Python
- SQLite
- Ollama
- Llama 3.2
- SQL

Workflow:

User Question → LLM → SQL Query → SQLite Database → Result

---

### EXP2 - RAG-Based Question Answering System

A knowledge base is used to retrieve relevant information before generating an answer using an LLM.

Technologies:
- Python
- Ollama
- Llama 3.2
- Sentence Transformers
- Scikit-learn

Workflow:

Knowledge Base → Chunking → Embeddings → Similarity Search → Relevant Context → LLM → Answer

---

### EXP3 - Prompt Chaining for Summarization

A multi-step LLM workflow where the output of one prompt becomes the input to the next prompt.

Technologies:
- Python
- Ollama
- Llama 3.2

Workflow:

Topic → Summary → Key Points → Questions

---

## Requirements

Install Ollama and download the Llama 3.2 model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
